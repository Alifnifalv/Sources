Analyze the following text extracted from an educational curriculum document. The text is structured with headings, subheadings, and bullet points representing different concepts and their associated learning objectives.
Document Text:
{document_text}
Extraction Instructions:
Dynamically identify:

All class names exactly as they appear (e.g., labels like Class / Div: X, {class_labels}, or similar patterns).
All subject names exactly as they appear (e.g., labels like Subject: X or equivalent).

Chapters Extraction Rules (Updated):
For each class and subject, extract the following fields verbatim:

Chapters:
Extract any entry in the document that satisfies any of the following patterns as a chapter_name:

Starts with:

Ch X:, Ch.X:, Chapter X: (e.g., Ch 1:, Chapter 2:), 

Revision, Revision Worksheet,lesson name or similar

IA:, FA:, SA: or similar internal assessments
These may appear in section headings or content cells — treat all matching entries as distinct chapters, even if they appear mid-document or repeat with continuation (e.g., Ch 2:... (contd...)).

Each extracted chapter should include:

"chapter_name": something like chapter(ch) or if there is lesson name consider it as chapter

"mark": Extract exactly as written or null if not present

"period": Extract exactly as written or null if not present

"month": Extract exactly as written or null if not present

IMPORTANT LESSON EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

In the document, look for sections like "Concepts/Subtopics" which contain numbered items
EACH numbered item in these sections (e.g., "1. Introduction to...", "2. Properties of...", etc.) represents a separate lesson
For EACH numbered item, you must create a separate lesson entry in the JSON output
If there are 5 numbered items, there should be 5 lesson entries in the output
Do not combine multiple numbered items into a single lesson
Extract all information as it appears without modification

Lessons within each chapter:

"Lesson_name": For each numbered item under "Subtopics", extract the exact text as it appears. Do not paraphrase or summarize. If explicitly labeled as "sub topic", use that text verbatim.
"date": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"period": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"learning_objectives": Extract the exact text of each learning objective as written without paraphrasing
"learning_outcomes": Extract the exact text of each learning outcome as written without paraphrasing
"content": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"skill_development": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"resources": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"reference_book": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"cross_disciplinary_connection": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"local_and_global_connection/sgd": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"qatar_values_Identity": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"teaching_strategy": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"activity_name": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"activity_description": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"duration": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"assessment": Extract the exact text of each assessment item as written without paraphrasing
"homework": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"differentiated_learning": {
"sen": Extract exactly as written or null if not present,
"high_achievers": Extract exactly as written or null if not present,
"improvement_needed": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
}
"alignment_to_vision": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
"post_class_reflection": Extract exactly as written or null if not present

STRICT EXTRACTION RULES:

DO NOT summarize, paraphrase, or create new sentences
DO NOT combine information from different sections
Extract text VERBATIM as it appears in the document
If a field is not explicitly present, set to null
Each numbered item under "Concepts/Subtopics" MUST be treated as a separate, distinct lesson
Preserve original formatting and wording exactly as it appears in the document
Do not infer or generate content that isn't explicitly stated
CRITICAL: The document contains a list of numbered items under section(s) like "Concepts/Subtopics" - EACH of these numbered items must be extracted as an individual lesson
For each numbered concept/subtopic, extract ALL related information that follows it in the document (e.g., learning objectives, teaching methodology, etc.)
Make sure every numbered item from the Concepts/Subtopics section appears as a separate lesson in the output

Exclusion Rules:
Ignore sections starting with or labeled as:

"Prescribed Books:"
"Reference:"
"Books Referred:"
"Rationale"
"Competencies"
Any other purely referential or theoretical content

⏱ Time Conversion Rule:
If "Time Duration" is listed in minutes, convert to periods assuming:

1 period = 45 minutes

Output Format:
Return only the following strict JSON:
