Analyze the following text extracted from an educational curriculum document. The text is structured with headings, subheadings, and bullet points representing different concepts and their associated learning objectives.

Document Text:
{document_text}

Extraction Instructions:
Dynamically identify:

All class names exactly as they appear (e.g., labels like Class / Div: X, {class_labels}, or similar patterns).
All subject names exactly as they appear (e.g., labels like Subject: X or equivalent).

## Chapters Extraction Rules (Updated):
For each class and subject, extract the following fields verbatim:

**Chapters:**
Extract any entry in the document that satisfies any of the following patterns as a chapter_name:

Starts with:
- Ch X:, Ch.X:, Chapter X: (e.g., Ch 1:, Chapter 2:), 
- Revision, Revision Worksheet, lesson name or similar
- IA:, FA:, SA: or similar internal assessments

These may appear in section headings or content cells — treat all matching entries as distinct chapters, even if they appear mid-document or repeat with continuation (e.g., Ch 2:... (contd...)).

Each extracted chapter should include:
- "ChapterName": something like chapter(ch) or if there is lesson name consider it as chapter
- "Mark": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "Period": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "Month": Extract exactly as written or null if not present

## IMPORTANT LESSON EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

In the document, look for sections like "Concepts/Subtopics" which contain numbered items
lesson names mostly comes under the subtopic
**Lessons within each chapter:**

- "LessonName": For each numbered item under "Subtopics", extract the exact text as it appears. Do not paraphrase or summarize. If explicitly labeled as "sub topic", use that text verbatim.
- "Date": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "Period": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "LessonLearningObjectiveName": Extract the exact text of each learning objective as written without paraphrasing
- "LessonLearningOutcomeName": Extract the exact text of each learning outcome as written without paraphrasing
- "Content": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
   If presented as a list  followed by lines, bullet points, or descriptions, combine each heading and its associated text into a **single string**, separated by a colon and a space .  
   Then **join all such entries using a newline `\n` separator**, and return as a **single string**.
- "SkillDevolepment": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "Resources": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "ReferenceBook": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- - "CrossDisciplinaryConnection": Extract exactly as written or null if not present. 
If presented as a list with headings like LANGUAGE, ART, etc., followed by lines, bullet points, or descriptions, combine each heading and its associated text into a single string, separated by a colon and a space (e.g., "LANGUAGE: ...") — then join all such entries using \n as a delimiter.  Do NOT convert to a dictionary or key-value format under any condition.

- "LocalAndGlobalConnection": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
If presented as a list with headings like LOCAL, GLOBAL, etc., followed by lines, bullet points, or descriptions, combine each heading and its associated text into a **single string**, separated by a colon and a space (e.g., "LOCAL: ...").  
Then **join all such entries using a newline `\n` separator**, and return as a **single string**.  

- "QatarValuesIdentity": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "TeachingStrategy": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "ActivityName": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "ActivityDescription": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "EstimatedDuration": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "Assessment": [
    "AssessmentName" : Extract exactly as written or null if not present donot include indroduction as assessment name.           
    "AssessmentDescription" : Extract exactly as written or null if not present. If presented as a list followed by lines, bullet points, or descriptions, combine each heading and its associated text into a **single string**, separated by a colon and a space.  
Then **join all such entries using a newline `\n` separator**, and return as a **single string**. 
]
- "HomeWorks": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "DifferentiatedLearning": {
  - "SEN": Extract exactly as written or null if not present,
  - "HighAchievers": Extract exactly as written or null if not present,
  - "StudentsWhoNeedImprovement": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
}
- "AllignmentToVisionAndMission": Extract exactly as written or null if not present
- "PostLessonEvaluation": Extract exactly as written or null if not present

## CRITICAL TEACHING METHODOLOGY EXTRACTION RULES:

**For TeachingMethodology section, identify time-based phases (e.g., "5 Minutes", "25 Minutes", "10 Minutes") and extract as separate methodology entries:**

1. **ActivityName**: Extract the phase name (e.g., "INTRODUCTION", "LESSON DEVELOPMENT AND INSTRUCTIONS", "CLOSURE")

2. **ActivityDescription**: Extract ONLY the actual teaching activities/methods described for that phase. Look for:
   - What the teacher does
   - What students do
   - Specific teaching actions
   - Learning activities
   - DO NOT include assessment descriptions here

3. **Assessment**: Extract ONLY assessment-related content such as:
   - "ORAL ASSESSMENT"
   - "WRITTEN ASSESSMENT"
   - Questions asked to check understanding
   - Evaluation methods
   - Testing procedures
   - Assessment criteria
   - DO NOT include teaching activities here.

4. **EstimatedDuration**: Extract the time allocated (e.g., "5 Minutes", "25 Minutes")

5. **TeachingStrategy**: Extract the overall strategy mentioned (e.g., "Learner-centred teaching and learning Strategy")

## STRICT EXTRACTION RULES:

- DO NOT summarize, paraphrase, or create new sentences
- DO NOT combine information from different sections
- Extract text VERBATIM as it appears in the document
- If a field is not explicitly present, set to null
- Each numbered item under "Concepts/Subtopics" MUST be treated as a separate, distinct lesson
- Preserve original formatting and wording exactly as it appears in the document
- Do not infer or generate content that isn't explicitly stated
- **CRITICAL**: Clearly distinguish between teaching activities (ActivityDescription) and assessment methods (Assessment)
- **CRITICAL**: The document contains a list of numbered items under section(s) like "Concepts/Subtopics" - EACH of these numbered items must be extracted as an individual lesson
- For each numbered concept/subtopic, extract ALL related information that follows it in the document (e.g., learning objectives, teaching methodology, etc.)
- Make sure every numbered item from the Concepts/Subtopics section appears as a separate lesson in the output

## Exclusion Rules:
Ignore sections starting with or labeled as:
- "Prescribed Books:"
- "Reference:"
- "Books Referred:"
- "Rationale"
- "Competencies"
- Any other purely referential or theoretical content

## ⏱ Time Conversion Rule:
If "Time Duration" is listed in minutes, convert to periods assuming:
- 1 period = 45 minutes

## Output Format:
Return only the following strict JSON:
