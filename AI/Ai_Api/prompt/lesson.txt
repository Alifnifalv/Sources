Please conduct a thorough analysis of the following excerpt taken from an educational curriculum document. This document is organized with a clear hierarchical structure that includes headings, subheadings,
and bullet points, which delineate various educational concepts and their corresponding learning objectives.

```
{document_text}
```
Your task is to dynamically extract and organize the following pieces of information from the text:

3. Chapter and Content Extraction
For each identified class and subject, extract the following details:

Chapters (structured either unit-wise or topic-wise) that include:

Chapter Name: Derive this from the section titles, headers, or unit names.
If the section refers to "Revision" or "Assessment", treat these as separate chapters.

Marks Assigned: Include this information if it is provided in the document.

Number of Periods: Include this information if it is available.

Concepts and Learning Objectives:

Extract concepts exclusively from the "Key Concepts" section or from closely related headings.

For each Concept, map it to its corresponding Learning Objectives. If no learning objectives are identified for a concept, set the learning_objectives field to null.

If no concepts are available for a chapter, the concepts field should also be set to null.

Learning objectives should be accurately associated with their respective concepts.

If a chapter contains multiple sections, consolidate all relevant information under the respective chapter.

Adhere strictly to the specified JSON structure and ensure proper formatting throughout.

Make sure to accurately extract values for periods and marks.

If "Time Duration" or periods are expressed in minutes (e.g., "450 minutes", "720 minutes"), set the "period" field to null.

Special Handling for "Social Science":

If the term "Social Science" is encountered, separate it into distinct subjects; otherwise, treat it as a single subject.

If a numbered item appears under a main section, consider it a concept within that chapter.

Exclusions: Do not include sections that serve solely as references. Specifically, omit any sections that begin with "Prescribed Books:", "Reference:", "Books Referred:", "Rationale", "Competencies", etc.

Expected Output
Return the extracted information exclusively in the following valid JSON format:

**Return ONLY valid JSON** with the following structure:
{
  "classes": [
    {
      "class": "string",
      "subjects": [
        {
          "subject": "string",
          "chapters": [
            {
              "chapter_name": "string",
              "mark": number,
              "period": number,
              "month": "string",
              "concepts": [
                {
                  "concept": "string",
                  "learning_objectives": ["string"]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Validation Requirements
Ensure that the generated JSON is strictly valid, adhering to the following criteria:

No missing or extra commas.

All string values must be enclosed in double quotes ("").

Arrays must be properly formatted with square brackets [ ].

No trailing commas should be present at the end of lists.

Special characters such as " and \ should be escaped correctly.

Perform a validation check on the JSON structure before returning it to ensure compliance with the specifications outlined above
